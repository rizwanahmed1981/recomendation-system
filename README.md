# Recommendation System

A simple and practical **Recommendation System** built using Python.  
This project is focused on understanding the core ideas behind recommendation engines, like how data is processed and how recommendations are generated.

Well, recommendation systems are everywhere, right?  
Netflix, YouTube, Amazon. So building one is a great learning move.

## 🚀 Features

- Data loading and preprocessing
- Basic recommendation logic
- Easy to understand Python implementation
- Beginner friendly project structure
- Can be extended to real world use cases

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas

You can easily plug in machine learning libraries later if you want.  
Can you imagine adding collaborative filtering or deep learning here?

Keeping things organized like this helps a lot when projects grow. Trust me.

## ⚙️ Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rizwanahmed1981/recomendation-system.git
cd recomendation-system
````

Create a virtual environment (recommended):

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # Linux / Mac
venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## ▶️ Usage

Run the recommendation script:

```bash
python src/recommend.py
```

You should see recommended items based on the dataset logic.
Simple now, but powerful later.

## 📈 Future Improvements

In my opinion, these would be great next steps:

* Add collaborative filtering
* Add content based recommendations
* Use real datasets
* Build a small web interface
* Integrate ML models

What do you think? Which one would you add first?
